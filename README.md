# Tealish

Welcome to my Tealish CLI Gem. This CLI Gem interacts with the user by displaying 3 tea flavor options to choose from. Once a flavor is selected, a list of tea products are displayed. The user can then enter a product number to view more details (description, ingredients) of the selected tea. Enjoy!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'tealish'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tealish

## Usage

Type `ruby bin/tealish` into your terminal and follow the prompts displayed.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
